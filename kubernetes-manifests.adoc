=== Introduction
Just like you did in link:../Lab-2.adoc[Lab 2] where you created a
docker-compose.yaml file to deploy your containerized application to Docker for
X in this module we will create the necessary configurations to deploy the
petstore into a Kubernetes cluster running in AWS connecting to an RDS database.

Before we get started making the deploy scripts for running the petstore on
Kubernetes, we're going to talk about Kubernetes basics.

==== Kubernetes Basics

// TODO: Do we need to do any introduction into k8s?

==== Getting Started

1. To get started, switch to the `kubernetes-manifests` folder within this repository. Then create
   a new file called `manifest.yaml`. Then open the `manifest.yaml` in your
   editor of choice.
2. Then we're going to create a `Deployment` and a `Service` that will show you how
   to recreate the swarm style deployment on top of Kubernetes.
3. Deploy it!

===== Create the Deployment

In the `manifest.yaml` you'll first need to define the 4 top level components of
a Kubenetes manifest.

[source,shell]
----
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:
----

In almost all Kubernetes manifest they will have these 4 keys, with the
acception of CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), Secrets, and ConfigMaps. The
apiVersion can be found along with the documentation for each Kubernetes
resource.

Next we'll fill them out. `apiVersion: apps/v1beta1` and `kind: Deployment` then
under `metadata:` we're going to create an object with `name` and `labels`

[source,shell]
----
name: petstore
labels:
  app: petstore
----

If you are deploying this into a `namespace` you will define that here.
Namespaces help you to create logical separations of applications, such as
`dev`, `test`, `prod` or at a service level.

Now we'll fill out the `spec`. The `spec` defines how the `Deployment` is
configured. the top level keys being `replicas`, `selector`, and `template`

For this application we're going to deploy only one `replica` so that should be
`replicas: 1`. For the selector we need to specify how the deployment is going
to be married to the pods it deploys.

[source,shell]
----
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: petstore
----

`matchLabels` is a manifest function of sorts that allows you to specify how it
references another resource. In this example we're referencing a
`ReplicaController` and `Pods` by the `label.app: petstore`

Last we'll define the `template` this includes all the information necessary to
run the application. including the `labels` for the pods, the container(s) the
port(s), volumes that need to be mounted or environment variables.

[source,shell]
----
metadata:
  labels:
    app: petstore
spec:
  containers:
  - name: petstore
    image: {REPLACE_WITH_ECR_REGISTRY}/petstore
    ports:
    - name: http-server
      containerPort: 8080
    - name: wildfly-cord
      containerPort: 9990
    env:
    - name: DB_URL
      value: "jdbc:postgresql://{REPLACE_WITH_RDS_URL}:5432/petstore?ApplicationName=applicationPetstore"
    - name: DB_HOST
      value: {REPLACE_WITH_RDS_HOST}
    - name: DB_PORT
      value: "5432"
    - name: DB_NAME
      value: petstore
    - name: DB_USER
      value: {REPLACE_WITH_RDS_USER}
    - name: DB_PASS
      value: {REPLACE_WITH_RDS_PASS}
----

IMPORTANT: If you don't replace `{REPLACE_WITH_RDS_HOST}`,
`{REPLACE_WITH_RDS_USER}`, `{REPLACE_WITH_RDS_PASS}`, `{REPLACE_WITH_RDS_URL}`
your deployment won't successfully pass.

Under the `spec.containers` you can see that we have and `image` which can be
Amazon Elastic Container Registry or any other Docker Registry,
link:https://quay.io[quay.io], link:https://hub.docker.com[hub.docker.com]. We
also have an `env` which define the host for the database host and username and
password.

To test your deployment you can use `kubectl` to deploy it.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
----

This will create a `deployment` then 1 subsequent `pod`

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl get deploy,pod
NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/petstore       1         1         1            1           1m

NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/petstore-694b766cc8-lqlvw       1/1       Running   0          1m
----

To view the application in it's current state you can run `port-forward` from
the `kubectl` like so.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get po -l app=petstore -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") 8080:8080
----

This will forward the remote port to `localhost:8080` if you are on macOS you
can view this by typing.

[source,shell]
----
open http://localhost:8080/applicationPetstore
----

At this point your application is running within Kubernetes but it's not able to
handle requests, this is due to the service not being externally exposed. To do
this Kubernetes has what is called a `Service`.

===== Create a Service

Now that we have our deployment up and running we need to create the service. To
do so you can add `---` below the `Deployment` yaml block. like so.

[source,shell]
----
---
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata: ...
spec: ...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: ...
spec: ...
----

With this inplace we can start to fill out all the necessary parts. For the
`metadata` attribute we need to define the `name` of the service. We typically
recommend using the same name as the pod/deployment to make this easy to
remember.

[source,shell]
----
metadata:
  name: petstore
----

For the `spec`, you use this to define the way that it selects the `pods` and
what ports it should be connected to.


[source,shell]
----
selector:
  name: petstore
ports:
- port: 80
  targetPort: http-server
  name: http
type: LoadBalancer
----

The above tells Kubernetes that you want to select a pod with a `name: petstore`
and then exposes the service on `port: 80`, mapping that to `targetPort:
http-server` as we defined in the `Deployment` it listens on `8080` that is
named `http-server`. Last, we define it as a `type: LoadBalancer` which will
instruct Kubernetes to boot an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

The finalized manifest should look something like.

[source,shell]
----
---
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: petstore
  labels:
    app: petstore
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: petstore
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: petstore
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: petstore
        image: christopherhein/petstore
        ports:
        - name: http-server
          containerPort: 8080
        - name: wildfly-cordination
          containerPort: 9990
        env:
        - name: DB_URL
          value: jdbc:postgresql://{REPLACE_WITH_RDS_URL}:5432/petstore?ApplicationName=applicationPetstore
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: {REPLACE_WITH_RDS_HOST}
        - name: DB_PORT
          value: 5432
        - name: DB_NAME
          value: petstore
        - name: DB_USER
          value: {REPLACE_WITH_RDS_USER}
        - name: DB_PASS
          value: {REPLACE_WITH_RDS_PASS}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: petstore
spec:
  selector:
    app: petstore
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: http-server
    name: http
  type: LoadBalancer
----


Now that we have a completed manifest we can apply the update to Kubernetes and
it will create the necessary resources, including the ELB and the port mapping.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
----

Now we can list the pods, deployments, and services running to see them all
together.


[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl get po,svc,deploy

NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/petstore-66ff5667c-ktchh        1/1       Running   0          39m

NAME                CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)          AGE
svc/petstore        100.70.102.228   a40625f2b3212...   80:30070/TCP     1h

NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/petstore       1         1         1            1           1h
----

Now that you can see the pods and services we can use the `-o wide` flag on the
`get svc` call to return the load balancer DNS, or use the second command to
parse it. and open.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get svc -o wide
----

Using the `kubectl` formatting:

[source,shell]
----
open http://$(kubectl get svc petstore -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress..hostname}")/applicationPetstore
----

==== Self Healing

One of the great things about Kubernetes is the built in ability to keep your
cluster at a specific state. Interally it is running a constant control loop
that is validating it's state against the stored state in the key value store
`etcd` when something is incorrect, (e.g. 3 pods are running instead of 4) it
will automatically "heal" and create a forth pod to fill that need. To
demonstrate this functionality you can try killing your running pod and seeing
it recreate itself.

Do do so first open a new terminal window that is running the watch command
triggered by using the `-w` command with `kubectl`

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get po -w
----

Now back in your original window we want to run the `delete` command on the
running pod. This will cause the Docker daemon to kill the pod and Kubernetes
will recreate it after a couple seconds.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete pod $(kubectl get po -l app=petstore -o jsonpath="{.items..metadata.name}")
----

As long as your are watching the `kubectl get po -w` window you will be able to
see a new pod gets created, while the first pod changes to a `Terminating`
state.

==== Updating Your Application

Now that we've seen how to Kubernetes can self-heal we need to understand how to
update your applications inplace. To do this we'll use the same command we used
to deploy the applications.

First update the `manifest.yaml` to have a `replicas: 2` key instead of a
`replicas: 1` this will tell Kubernetes to boot a second version of the petstore
application so that it had 2 copies. After you have done that you can `apply`
those changes.

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f manifest.result.yaml
deployment "petstore" configured
service "petstore" configured
----

You might notice but the above command `configured` each of the `deployment` and
the `service` this means that it did an update to the running version in
Kubernetes. Then the control loop made it happen.

To see the running pod you can list both pods with the `get po` command.

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl get po
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
petstore-66ff5667c-7vvsd        1/1       Running   0          1m
petstore-66ff5667c-jgksd        1/1       Running   0          1m
----
