== Application Discovery

=== Expected Outcome:

- Understand general application portfolio discovery when migrating workloads.
- What is specific about application discovery and migrating to containers.
- Brief introduction into tools that can assist in dissecting an application.

=== Lab Requirements:
None

=== Average Lab Time:
10 Minutes.

=== Introduction
Any cloud migration should go through five phases - Evaluation, Planning, Design,
Migration and Optimization. Portfolio Discovery refers to a process that 
generates IT inventory data about applications, servers, network devices, and 
storage which are deployed in a customer's environment. Typically, this
process is done with a tool and the goals of Portfolio Discovery are:

1. Create an inventory of the source environment at the application level.
2. Understand the applications utilization metrics.
3. Get a clear map of the dependent systems or services for a given application.
4. Use this information to start a migration plan.
5. Project migration and post-migration costs in AWS.

=== Discovery Analysis - What to Look For
 
From the vast amount of portfolio data collected, there are key pieces of information
extracted that are the basis of what you need to form a migration plan. For example,
dependencies can be considered one of the most important pieces. They help determine
application and server dependencies but also help identify access patterns. Performance
metrics is another factor to help right size resources when migrating to the cloud. 
Other areas are service naming conventions, tags and other host metadata to help
identify patterns and group servers into applications for migration.

=== Application Discovery and Containerization

When looking at an application footprint during the discovery process you can break it into a couple of categories
in terms of ease of migrating to containers. They are:

|====================================================================================================================================================
|                | *Easy*                               | *Moderate*                                           | *Difficult*                            
| *Code*         | Completely Isolated (single process) | Somewhat isolated (multiple processes)               | Self-Modifying (e.g. Actor Model)    
| *Configuration*| One Configuration File               | Several Configuration Files                          | Configuration Anywhere in Filesystem 
| *Data*         | Data Saved in Single Place           | Data Saved in Several Places                         | Data Anywhere in Filesystem          
| *Secrets*      | Static Files                         | Network                                              | Dynamic Generation of Certificates   
| *Network*      | HTTP, HTTPS                          | TCP, UDP                                             | IPSEC, Highly Isolated               
| *Installation* | Packages, Source                     | Installers (install.sh) and Understood Configuration | Installers (install.sh)              
| *Licensing*    | Open Source                          | Proprietary                                          | Restrictive & Proprietary            
|====================================================================================================================================================

While not called out above, dependencies are critical when performing application discovery in all
phases of a migration but they are especially important when it comes to deciding to break out an
application to microservices. Identifying all external resources and dependencies along with the 
metrics associated are a critical component of your migration.

=== What or Where to Break Out

A common approach is to just try and refactor everything. While this works well it can be time consuming.
It also assumes that you know the application well and have the time to do the work. It can be more
beneficial to try and break the application into small services or in chunks. By creating a service diagram
and getting the metrics around the interactions are a way to look for opportunities to break into services.

=== What Tools to Use

There are a mix of tools in the market that perform Portfolio discovery. Some tools work by scanning the 
network or targeting a series of hosts and logging in via ssh, wmi or snmp. Others are agent-based and need
to be installed on each machine within an application footprint to collect metrics.

=== Discovery Tools 

The tools below are typically used during the Portfolio Discovery process. What is important to note here is 
that none of the tools in this space will give you the deep understanding about the underlying components of
an application. While they do a great job of discovering cpu, memory, network, disk and dependencies, they don't
go deep in areas like installed packages and versions or visualizing if a dependency is tightly coupled along
with the metrics around it (e.g. response time visualization).

=== Profiling Tools (APM)

The tools below are traditionally thought of as a post migration tool but can be leveraged as part of the
dissection of an application. They have the ability to bubble up process level information and can go deeper
into the application stack to get a true representation of what the application is doing under the covers.

=== Conclusion

Regardless of the tools used, it is important to note that recording the metrics and response times are 
required during the application discovery process because that information is used in the post migration phase
as a baseline comparison. The goal is to ensure that key areas like performance, stability and resource
consumption don't deteriorate as part of the migration. This information will also be used as part of your test
plans when it comes time to test the scaling of the services that have been migrated.
