=== The Lab

==== Overview

Now that we have the Pet Store application containerized and leveraging k8s
for deployment and application lifecycle management it is time to automate the
deployment process. In this part of the workshop we will deploy a Jenkins container
pre-configured and use it to deploy new versions of the Pet Store application. We will
discover common CI/CD concepts and introduce testing and security functionality as part
 of the deployment process.
